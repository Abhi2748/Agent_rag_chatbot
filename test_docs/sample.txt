Title: The Whispering Woods
Once upon a time, in a quiet village surrounded by dense forests, there lived a young girl named Mira. She was known for her curiosity and love for nature.
One day, Mira heard a soft whisper coming from the woods. Intrigued, she followed the sound deep into the trees, where she discovered an old, forgotten path.
As she walked along the path, she found glowing flowers and talking animals who guided her to a magical tree. The tree told her she had been chosen to protect the forestâ€™s secrets.
From that day on, Mira visited the woods often, learning its mysteries and guarding its wonders. And though she grew older, the magic never left her heart.

The villagers still speak of Mira, the girl who listened to the whispers of the woods.

The End.
